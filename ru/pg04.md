===============

[Map of Geocoded Towns]({{ site.baseurl }}/leaflet.html)
-----------------------
This is a Leaflet map of the towns that have been successfully geocoded in our dataset. In this map, you can see locations, administrative units, full descriptions from the text, and links to both the source material on Hathi Trust and the GeoNames page for the modern equivalent town.

[Market Town Fairs (Paschal)](https://jaguillette.cartodb.com/viz/1c6e86b0-ab16-11e4-81da-0e4fddd5de28/public_map)
-----------------------------
A map showing fairs occurring across the Russian Empire in 1788. This map also distinguishes between Paschal, or Easter-based, holidays, which can move around the year based on Easter, and ordinary holidays which occur on the same date every year.

###If you make one, let us know!
