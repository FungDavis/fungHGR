Connecting the Past to the Present
==================================
The __Toponimika__ project, run by [Fung Library](http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/fung/) and the [Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies](http://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu/), is a pilot project exploring best practices for extracting information from historical texts and presenting that information in a useful way.  
  
For a general overview of the project, check out our [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/pg01.html) page. If you want to jump right in to either [geocoding]({{ site.baseurl }}/pg02.html) or [text processing]({{ site.baseurl }}/pg03.html), then check out those pages. We also have a small gallery of  [visualizations]({{ site.baseurl }}/pg04) produced by the project. If you really want to get into the nuts and bolts of the project, then go ahead and [fork us on GitHub](https://github.com/fungDavis/fungHGR). Don't forget to go to our [Team]({{ site.baseurl }}/pg05.html) page to see the people who brought this project to fruition.

Coming Soon!
============
Weâ€™re still working on this site, which will present the results of our investigation into the processes and workflows that can best support the automated creation of a _historical gazetteer_ based on historical texts. Come back soon!
