This project is an outgrowth of a larger project led by Kelly O'Neill, Associate Professor of History at Harvard University, the [Imperiia project](https://sites.google.com/site/imperiiagis/home) to promote the study of Russia’s spatial history. It is managed by Hugh Truslow, Librarian for the Fung Library and Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Collection at Harvard’s Fung Library. Project code was written by Jeremy Guillette, Research Assistant at Fung Library. Invaluable advuice and guidance was provided by Lex Berman, Project Manager of the [China Historical GIS project](http://fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/chgis_home.html), whose expertise in the creation of historical gazetteers cannot be overstated. One way we are making the project data available is through Lex's [Temporal Gazetteer API project](http://chgis.hmdc.harvard.edu/tgaz/), as well as by download from this site. We have also benefitted in ways large and small from our close proximity to Harvard’s Center for Geographic Analysis, where Lex works. Finally, thanks are due to the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies for their support of this project, especially Alexandra Vacroux, Executive Director, and Maria C. Altamore, Director of Administration and Finance.
