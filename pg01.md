About the Project
=================

The Historical Gazetteer of Russia project is a pilot project intended to test the possibilities of extracting and using information from historical texts with as little human intervention as possible. This means that we rely on Python scripts, not students, to extract information from our chosen text.

The Text
--------

We have used "[Словарь учрежденных в России ярмарок и торгов](http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006277212)" or "Dictionary of Fairs and Trades established in Russia" as our source text. It contains a description of market fairs held throughout Russia in the late 1700s, organized alphabetically by town name. Each town describes which administrative unit it is part of, when market fairs are held, and what goods are traded at the fairs, all in varying levels of detail.  
  
What makes this text both interesting and a good starting point for automated information extraction is the consistent description of economic activity during a time of administrative reform. From it we can glean a high-level view of the Russian Empire at the time, both administratively and economically. As a test for automated information extraction it is also a useful case, as it is relatively limited in scope, leaving less room for variability in meaning, and mostly consistent in description, meaning that granular pieces of data can be extracted much more easily than from a larger text.

The Information
---------------

There were two general categories of information that we wanted to derive from this text. The first is an accurate mapping of the towns and cities described in the text to their modern-day equivalents. Secondly, we wanted to take out descriptions of market activity from the text so that we could compare aggregate trading patterns.  
  
### Geographic Information
To map the towns described in the text to their modern equivalents, we primarily used [Geonames.org](http://www.geonames.org/) as both the system by which towns are uniquely identified and the service through which we reconciled our data to the modern world. We did this by querying the [Geonames API](http://www.geonames.org/export/geonames-search.html) with the names of our towns in the areas of their Namiestnichestva (a state, province, or oblast level administrative division which existed in Russia from 1775 to 1796). Through this process, we were able to automatically geocode ~35% of the dataset, with the remainder of the dataset requiring human intervention to determine which possible matches were likely to be the one matching the description. Although the purely automated geocoding wasn't as successful as we had hoped, starting from a list of possible candidates instead of from scratch for each entry was also quite useful for manually reconciling additional towns.  
  
The process is described in more detail on the [Geocoding]({{ site.baseurl }}pg02.html) page.  
  
### Trading Information
To extract information about trading patterns from the text, we ended up taking the same general approach for text describing both when market fairs were held, and what goods were exchanged at them. Using a combination of regular expressions and Python's [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org/), patterns of text were examined and from those patterns, we derived lookup strategies to extract and standardize textual data. For example, trade goods are frequently described in the text in the instrumental case, and in sentences with verbs related to trade. To find trade goods, we found words in the instrumental case in sentences with those trade-related verbs, removed the ones that weren't actually describing trade goods, and used the rest as a dictionary to look up those trade items in any form. This general approach of finding a common pattern, extracting meaning from it, and using the results to find all cases of that pattern was found to be quite useful in automating a relatively comprehensive text extraction process.  
  
This process is described more fully on the [Text Extraction](#) page.  
  
Team
----
This project represents a collaboration between scholars across fields. The project was lead by Hugh Truslow, Head Librarian and Librarian for the Davis Center Russian/Eurasian Collection at Fung Library. Project code was written by Jeremy Guillette, Research Assistant at Fung Library. The project could also not have been completed without assitance and guidance from Kelly O'Neill, Associate Professor of History at Harvard University, and Lex Berman, Project Manager of the [China Historical GIS project](http://fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/chgis_home.html). We are also serving our data as a gazetteer through Lex's [Temporal Gazetteer project](#), in addition to as a download from this site.
