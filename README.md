Constructing a historical gazetteer of Russia

This is the project page for the Toponomika project, running out of Fung Library as part of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. This project is currently in a pilot phase, with the eventual goal of providing a workflow to create a historical gazetteer of Russia based on historical place names. Check out [our website](http://fungdavis.github.io/fungHGR) for more details!
