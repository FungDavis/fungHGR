===============
This project represents a collaboration between scholars across fields. The project was lead by Hugh Truslow, Head Librarian and Librarian for the Davis Center Russian/Eurasian Collection at Fung Library. Project code was written by Jeremy Guillette, Research Assistant at Fung Library. The project could also not have been completed without assitance and guidance from Kelly O'Neill, Associate Professor of History at Harvard University, and Lex Berman, Project Manager of the [China Historical GIS project](http://fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/chgis_home.html). We are also serving our data as a gazetteer through Lex's [Temporal Gazetteer project](#), in addition to as a download from this site.
